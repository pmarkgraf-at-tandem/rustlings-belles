# Retrospectives

## 2025-11-19

### We changed up some stuff today. How did our experiment go?

* Much better
  * Felt we are learning and collaborating together
  * Felt like how we usually work together
* Wish referenced didn't use the ampersand... because of the differences from C++

### What thoughts do you have on Rustlings?

* Glad you are game to try something new.
* Have we done any of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems?
  * David has, Ethan has, Phil has not.
  * Phil uses [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) when learning languages.
* I am feeling pressured... anxiety at having people watching me code
  * Similar feeling, but think it is good practice to work through

### What to try next time

* One scribe, multiple navigators
  * Probably fits how we would actually apply this
