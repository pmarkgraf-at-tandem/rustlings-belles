# Retrospectives

## 2025-12-22

### What went well today?

* Liked that we went slow and thought things through
* Learned the "why" of the various options
* Did some experimentation of other approaches
* Want to build a project with this to exercise making the choices

## 2025-12-03

* Strings are pretty easy
  * Lots of functions!
  * Reminds us of Python & Java
* Modules are powerful
  * Reminiscent of C++, Python & Java

### What are my reflections today

* Enums are neat
  * These appear very powerful
* This will definitely need some practice
* Destructuring will also take some practice (but is also pretty powerful)
* Y'all did a great job figuring this out

### What did I observe

* Flow went pretty good
  * I feel like we are getting the hang of it
* Maybe we could take more time to read the documentation
  * Maybe post the links into the chat

### We changed up some stuff today. How did our experiment go?

* Much better
  * Felt we are learning and collaborating together
  * Felt like how we usually work together
* Wish referenced didn't use the ampersand... because of the differences from C++

### What thoughts do you have on Rustlings?

* Glad you are game to try something new.
* Have we done any of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems?
  * David has, Ethan has, Phil has not.
  * Phil uses [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) when learning languages.
* I am feeling pressured... anxiety at having people watching me code
  * Similar feeling, but think it is good practice to work through

### What to try next time

* One scribe, multiple navigators
  * Probably fits how we would actually apply this
